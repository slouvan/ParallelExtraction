AAC	AAC is a file format for storing music or other sounds .
AAC	It stands for Advanced Audio Coding or Advanced Audio Codec .
AAC	It is used by Apple Inc. in the iPod and iTunes .
AAC	AAC is one of the standard formats that comes from the MPEG organization , the same people who invented MP3 .
AAC	There are several flavors of AAC .
AAC	These are the most popular : AAC LC-the format used by Apple software ; it takes up more space and is used for music stored on an iPod , CD-ROM , or disk drive .
AAC	HE-AAC v1-a more efficient format ; it saves space for music sent over a network , like over the Internet or to a cell phone .
AAC	Brand names for this format include aacPlus ™ , Nero Digital ™ , and AAC + .
AAC	HE-AAC v2-an even more efficient format for music sent over a network .
AAC	Brand names for this format include aacPlus ™ v2 , eAAC + ™ , and AAC + Enhanced ™ .
AAC	Here are some common AAC file name endings : .
AAC	aac-music only .
AAC	.
AAC	m4a-music and information .
AAC	m4p-music and information , with DRM .
AAC	m4b-speech and information , `` Audiobook '' recognized by Apple that keeps the listener 's position .
AAC	m4r-music and information used by Apple as a ringtone .
AAC	mp4-music , video , or both , plus information .
AAC	An AAC file that has only music and information could have a name that ends with either .
AAC	m4a or .
AAC	mp4 .
AAC	A KDE\/Qt application for Linux\/Unix called easytag will edit metadata about AAC-encoded files as long as they end with the .
AAC	m4a extension .
AAC	Typically , renaming file files to .
AAC	m4a and back to the original extension after editing is sufficient .

Absolute_zero	In theory , absolute zero is the temperature where the particles of matter stop moving .
Absolute_zero	Absolute zero is impossible to achieve , because all particles move , even if it is just a small vibration .
Absolute_zero	Some people have created temperatures very close to absolute zero , but the record temperature was 100 pK ( Picokelvin ) above absolute zero .
Absolute_zero	Even getting close to absolute zero is difficult because anything that touches an object being cooled near absolute zero would give heat to the objects .
Absolute_zero	Scientists use lasers to slow atoms when cooling objects to very low temperatures .
Absolute_zero	The Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales are defined so that absolute zero is 0 kelvins ( K ) or 0 degrees Rankine ( ° R ) .
Absolute_zero	The Celsius and Fahrenheit scales are defined so that absolute zero is − 273.15 ° C or − 459.67 ° F. At this stage the pressure of the particles is zero .
Absolute_zero	If we plot a graph to it , we can see that the temperature of the particles is zero .
Absolute_zero	The temperature can not go down any further .
Absolute_zero	Also , the particles can not move in `` reverse '' either because as the movement of particles is vibration , vibrating in reverse would be nothing but simply vibrating again .
Absolute_zero	The closer the temperature of an object gets to absolute zero , the less resistive the material is to electricity therefore it will conduct electricity almost perfectly , with no measurable resistance .
Absolute_zero	The Third Law of Thermodynamics says that nothing can ever have a temperature of absolute zero .
Absolute_zero	The Second Law of Thermodynamics says that all engines that are powered by heat ( like car engines and steam train engines ) must release waste heat and ca n't be 100 % efficient .
Absolute_zero	This is because the efficiency ( percent of energy the engine uses up that is actually used to do the engine 's job ) is 100 % × ( 1-Toutside\/Tinside ) , which only is 100 % if the outside temperature is absolute zero which it ca n't be .
Absolute_zero	So , an engine ca n't be 100 % efficient , but you can make its efficiency closer to 100 % by making the inside temperature hotter and\/or the outside temperature colder .

Alchemy	Alchemy is a study of the basic elements called fire , water , earth and air .
Alchemy	It is the study of transmutation .
Alchemy	It was first studied to learn how to change lead into gold .
Alchemy	It is similar to chemistry , but much older .
Alchemy	People who studied alchemy were called alchemists .
Alchemy	Alchemists in the Middle Ages often tried to make gold using things that were not gold .
Alchemy	They also tried to make the Elixir of Life ( which would give the gift of immortality ) .
Alchemy	Many times alchemists would use stories and legends to try to veil ( cover up ) how to make gold .
Alchemy	The psychologist Carl Gustav Jung was interested in this as well but in relation to the soul of man .
Alchemy	Alchemists are objective ( they deal with external existence ) while psychologists are subjective ( they deal with the inner life of man ) .
Alchemy	Alchemists deal with the First Matter ( a substance that makes transmutation easy ) while Psychology deals with the mind .
Alchemy	A famous saying in Alchemy : `` As above , so below '' veils the relationship existing between Alchemy and Psychology .
Alchemy	Alchemy is not a science any more .
Alchemy	Some things that the alchemists learned about were important for other sciences , like chemistry .
Alchemy	In 1980 , an American scientist named Glenn Seaborg actually changed a very tiny amount of bismuth into gold with a nuclear reactor .
Alchemy	But it cost much more to transform the energy to do this than the tiny amount of gold was worth .
Alchemy	This is the closest a scientist has come to discover the Philosopher 's Stone of the ancient Alchemists .
Alchemy	The Philosopher 's Stone is the means ( way ) Alchemists use to achieve ( to succeed in ) transmutation .
Alchemy	Alchemy was an important science because it helped create many other sciences that came after it , for example , Chemistry , Physics , Biology , and astronomy .
Alchemy	Alchemists not only tried to create gold but they also looked for self-purification ( to separate the pure from the impure with great care ) and enlightenment .

African_elephant	Males stand 3.64 meters ( 12 feet ) tall at the shoulder and weigh 5455 kg ( 12,000 lbs ) , while females stand 3 meters ( 10 feet ) and weigh 3636 kg to 4545 kg ( 8,000 to 10,000 lbs ) .
African_elephant	The largest bulls will weigh 24,000 pounds ( 12 tons ) and stand a little over ( 13 feet ) at the shoulder .
African_elephant	Elephants have four molars , each weighs about 11 lbs and measures about 12 inches long .
African_elephant	The front pair wear down and drop out in pieces as the Two new molars emerge in the back of the mouth and the old molars shift forward .
African_elephant	to replace those that dropped out .
African_elephant	Elephants replace their teeth six times .
African_elephant	At about 40 to 60 years of age the elephant no longer has teeth and will likely die of starvation , a common cause of death .
African_elephant	Their tusks are teeth , the second set of incisors become the tusks .
African_elephant	They are used for digging for roots and stripping the bark off trees for food , and , fighting each other during mating season , or defending themselves against predators .
African_elephant	They weigh from 50-100 pounds and can be from can be from 5 to 8 feet long .
African_elephant	Both bulls and cows have tusks .
African_elephant	.
African_elephant	Loxodonta adaurora , extinct , presumed antecedent of the modern African elephants .
African_elephant	African Bush Elephant ( Loxodonta africana ) .
African_elephant	African Forest Elephant ( Loxodonta cyclotis ) .
African_elephant	Bush and Forest Elephants were formerly considered subspecies of the same species Loxodonta africana .
African_elephant	However , they are nowadays generally considered to be two distinct species .
African_elephant	The African Forest Elephant has a longer and narrower mandible , rounder ears , a different number of toenails , straighter and downward tusks , and considerably smaller size .
African_elephant	With regard to the number of toenails : the African Bush Elephant normally has 4 toenails on the front foot and 3 on the hind foot , the African Forest Elephant normally has 5 toenails on the front foot and 4 on the hind foot ( like the Asian elephant ) , but hybrids between the two species commonly occur .
African_elephant	Poaching significantly reduced the population of Loxodonta in certain regions during the 20th century .
African_elephant	An example of this poaching pressure is in the eastern region of Chad-elephant herds there were substantial as recently as 1970 , with an estimated population of 400,000 ; however , by 2006 the number had dwindled to about 10,000 .
African_elephant	The African elephant nominally has governmental protection , but poaching is still a serious issue .
African_elephant	Human encroachment into or adjacent to natural areas where bush elephants occur has led to recent research into methods of safely driving groups of elephants away from humans , including the discovery that playback of the recorded sounds of angry honey bees are remarkably effective at prompting elephants to flee an area .
African_elephant	Some elephant communities have grown so large , in Africa , that some communities have resulted to culling large amounts to help sustain the ecosystem .
African_elephant	All in all African elephants are some of the smartest land animales in the world .

Aegyptosaurus	Aegyptosaurus , meaning `` Egypt 's Lizard '' after the country where it was discovered ( comes from the Greek word sauros , which means ` lizard ' ) , is a genus of sauropod dinosaur that lived in Africa around 95 million years ago , during the Late Cretaceous period .
Aegyptosaurus	Like most sauropods , it had a long neck and a small skull .
Aegyptosaurus	The animal 's long tail probably acted as a counterweight to its body mass .
Aegyptosaurus	Its tail also ended in a whip-like structure that it used to defend itself against predatory dinosaurs that lived in the same place and time as it , such as Carcharodontosaurus and Spinosaurus .
Aegyptosaurus	Aegyptosaurus was a close relative of Argentinosaurus , a much larger dinosaur that lived in South America at about the same time .
Aegyptosaurus	This suggests a possible land bridge between Africa and South America during the Cretaceous period .

Advaita_Vedanta	Advaita Vedanta is a type of Hinduism .
Advaita_Vedanta	People who believe in Advaita believe that their soul is never really different from God .
Advaita_Vedanta	The Sanskrit word for soul is Atman and the Sanskrit word for God is Brahman .
Advaita_Vedanta	The most famous Hindu philosopher was named Adi Shankara who lived in India more than a thousand years ago .
Advaita_Vedanta	Adi Sankara learned the sacred texts of Hinduism , like Vedas and Upanishads under his teacher Govinda Bhagavadpada and later wrote extensive commentaries of Hindu sacred texts called Upanishads .
Advaita_Vedanta	In these commentaries , he proposed the theory of Advaita , saying that the Upanishad actually teach that the individual soul ( called Atman ) is not different from God ( called Brahman ) .
Advaita_Vedanta	He also taught that there is only one essential principle called Brahman ( means God ) and everything else is a kind of expression of that one Brahman .
Advaita_Vedanta	Because of this theory of one being , his teachings became popular as the `` Advaita '' ( a = not , dvaita = two , means no-two or non-dual ) .
Advaita_Vedanta	The way he said this to people was `` Atman is Brahman . ''
Advaita_Vedanta	Adi Shankara was very smart and knew that people would wonder how he could say such an odd thing .
Advaita_Vedanta	He realized that many people would ask him , `` If a person 's soul is really one with God all along , then what makes a person feel so separate from God ? ''
Advaita_Vedanta	His answer to this was that we are ignorant of our real self being God because we see through a kind of filter -- like looking through a dirty piece of glass -- and he called this filter we look through , maya , which means `` illusion '' in Sanskrit .
Advaita_Vedanta	Shankara said that our ignorance makes us feel very separate from God , and even from everything around us .
Advaita_Vedanta	Shankara suggested that the best way people can find the truth is for them to try to clear their thinking of all ignorant thoughts , be very good , and think very hard about who they really are .
Advaita_Vedanta	He said that if a person did all these things he would realize that God was himself all along .
Advaita_Vedanta	This is a very different idea from some other religions where we are told we are separate from God and need to go to Him .
Advaita_Vedanta	In Advaita , the idea is that people never really were separate from God , but their ignorance made them see it that way .
Advaita_Vedanta	Not all Hindus believe in Advaita Vedanta .
Advaita_Vedanta	Many others believe there is a difference between a person 's soul and God , just like in many other religions .

Arrangement_(music)	An arrangement of a musical composition is a reworking of a piece of music so that it can be played by a different instrument or combination of instruments from the original .
Arrangement_(music)	For example , a song written for one voice with piano accompaniment might be arranged so that it can be sung in parts by a choir , or a piece for violin might be arranged so that it can be played on a clarinet instead .
Arrangement_(music)	The person who does the arrangement may be the composer himself , or it may be someone else .
Arrangement_(music)	In music history , composers often published their compositions , saying that the music could be played or sung by various instruments .
Arrangement_(music)	For example , when English composers published madrigals in the late 16th century they often stated that they could be sung by singers or played on viols ( `` apt for voices as for viols '' ) .
Arrangement_(music)	In the Classical music period a composer might publish a sonata , stating that it could be played on the violin or flute or recorder .
Arrangement_(music)	This helped to sell more copies , because violinists , flautists and recorder players might all want to buy the music .
Arrangement_(music)	In a sense this is not really an arrangement , because no changes have been made to the music .
Arrangement_(music)	However , when violin or cello music is arranged so that it can be played on a viola , some changes may be necessary as the viola may be playing in a different key , or some chords may be more awkward the way they were originally written .
Arrangement_(music)	This in an arrangement .
Arrangement_(music)	A popular piece such as The Flight of the Bumble Bee by Rimsky-Korsakov can be played by almost any melodic instrument : violin , xylophone , tuba etc. .
Arrangement_(music)	These are all arrangements .
Arrangement_(music)	When a piece for choir and orchestra is printed for choir members to use , the orchestral part is printed on two staves so that it can be played on a piano for rehearsals .
Arrangement_(music)	This is another kind of arrangement .
Arrangement_(music)	In music history , many composers have made arrangements of music composed by others .
Arrangement_(music)	They did this in order to learn about musical composition , as well as in order to be able to play it on another instrument .
Arrangement_(music)	For example , Johann Sebastian Bach made arrangements of four concertos by Vivaldi so that they could be played on the organ .
Arrangement_(music)	Arrangements are often made by people who play instruments that have not had much music written for them .
Arrangement_(music)	People who play the viola , guitar , tuba etc often arrange other music so that they have a larger repertoire ( more music to play ) .
Arrangement_(music)	Sometimes composers have made changes to the orchestration of works for orchestra written by others .
Arrangement_(music)	They may have done this because instruments had changed since the music was written , or simply because they thought they could do it better .
Arrangement_(music)	For example , Mozart made an arrangement of Handels Messiah , adding instruments such as clarinets which Handel would not have known .
Arrangement_(music)	Rimsky-Korsakov made arrangements of the operas by Musorgsky thinking that he was improving them .
Arrangement_(music)	Arrangements are sometimes made because a player has some disability .
Arrangement_(music)	Cyril Smith , a pianist who only had one arm , played piano duets with his wife Phyllis Sellick .
Arrangement_(music)	They arranged piano duets so that they could be played by three hands .
Arrangement_(music)	Sometimes arrangements are made of well-known classical pieces in which the music is `` jazzed up '' or made to sound more popular for movie or theater performances .
Arrangement_(music)	Sometimes musicians think this is not a good thing .
Arrangement_(music)	Sometimes small vocal groups such as the Swingle Singers make lighthearted versions of works by Bach and others .
Arrangement_(music)	Musicians will never all agree about which is better : an arrangement or the original version .
Arrangement_(music)	Each piece of music should really be judged on its own .

Andrew_Huxley	These are the electrical impulses that make nerve fibers work , and so the whole central nervous system .
Andrew_Huxley	Hodgkin and Huxley shared the prize that year with Sir John Eccles , who was cited for research on nerve synapses .
Andrew_Huxley	Hodgkin and Huxley 's findings led the pair to suggest the existence of ion channels , which were found only decades later .
Andrew_Huxley	Huxley was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society on 17 March 1955 .
Andrew_Huxley	He was President of the Royal Society from 1980 to 1985 , and Master of Trinity from 1984-1990 .

Alphonse_Mucha	Alphonse Mucha , ( 24 July 1860 - 14 July 1939 ) , was a Czech Art Nouveau painter and decorative artist , best known for his distinct style and his images of women .
Alphonse_Mucha	He produced many paintings , illustrations , advertisements , and designs .
Alphonse_Mucha	Mucha moved to Paris in 1887 , continued his studies , and worked at producing magazine and advertising illustrations .
Alphonse_Mucha	Around Christmas 1894 , Mucha happened to drop into a print shop where there was a sudden and unexpected need for a new advertising poster for a play starring Sarah Bernhardt , the most famous actress in Paris .
Alphonse_Mucha	Mucha volunteered to produce a lithographed poster within two weeks , and on 1 January 1895 , the advertisement for the play Gismonda by Victorien Sardou appeared on the streets of the city .
Alphonse_Mucha	It was an overnight sensation and announced the new artistic style and its creator to the citizens of Paris .
Alphonse_Mucha	Bernhardt was so satisfied with the success of this first poster that she entered into a 6 year contract with Mucha .
Alphonse_Mucha	Mucha produced a flurry of paintings , posters , advertisements , and book illustrations , as well as designs for jewellery , carpets , wallpaper , and theater sets in what was initially called the Mucha Style but became known as Art Nouveau ( French for ` new art ' ) .
Alphonse_Mucha	Mucha 's works frequently featured beautiful , strong young women in flowing vaguely Neoclassical looking robes , often surrounded by lush flowers which sometimes formed halos behind the women 's heads .
Alphonse_Mucha	In contrast with contemporary poster makers he used pale pastel colors .
Alphonse_Mucha	The 1900 Paris Exhibition spread the `` Mucha style '' abroad , of which Mucha said `` I think ( the Exposition Universelle ) made some contribution toward bringing aesthetic values into arts and crafts . ''
Alphonse_Mucha	He decorated the Bosnia and Herzegovina Pavilion and collaborated in the Austrian Pavilion .
Alphonse_Mucha	Mucha 's Art Nouveau style was often imitated .
Alphonse_Mucha	The Art Nouveau style however , was one that Mucha attempted to distance himself from .
Alphonse_Mucha	He always insisted that his paintings came purely from within and from Czech art .
Alphonse_Mucha	He declared that art existed only to communicate a spiritual message , and nothing more .
Alphonse_Mucha	He was frustrated at the fame he gained through commercial art , when he most wanted to concentrate on more lofty projects that would ennoble art and his birthplace .
